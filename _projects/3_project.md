#Professionalism: 

During my attendance I ensured that I was punctual and attended the office on the days that were agreed. There was one day I needed to let my supervisor know that I needed to switch days and let him know as soon as I knew I wouldn’t make it. I still attended the two days in the week. As part of professionalism, I asked if there was a company dress code, and because my role was not client facing, I could wear more casual attire. Riding my motorbike each day, I made sure I wore a collared polo shirt, jeans and smart casual shoes. I had my own email account, although the team communicated in person or over teams, I noticed that I hadn’t checked it for 2 weeks and company emails began piling up. I realised that this wasn’t very professional as I had missed out on important announcements and I will be checking and sorting emails each day. 

 

#Use of AI: 

Most team members use ChatGPT on a regular basis to help with ideas and solutions to problems. I also used ChatGPT especially while learning C# and other libraries and frameworks. There were times when I needed ChatGPT to write me a piece of code that I couldn’t work out, although the code didn’t do exactly what I intended or explained. Writing my report and findings for the company would have been more efficient using ChatGPT to do this, although ChatGPT has helped with ideas and learning, I thought that this might be unethical for it to write the report for me, so I decided against it.
