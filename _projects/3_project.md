Professionalism

During my attendance I ensured that I was punctual and attended the office on the days that were agreed.

There was one day I needed to let my supervisor know that I needed to switch days and let him know as soon as I knew I wouldn’t make it, I still attended the two days in the week. 

As part of professionalism, I asked if there was a company dress code, and because my role was not client facing, I could wear more casual attire. 
Riding my motorbike each day, I made sure I wore a collared polo shirt, jeans and smart casual shoes.

I had my own email account, although the team communicated in person or over teams, I noticed that I hadn’t checked it for 2 weeks and company emails began piling up.

I realised that this wasn’t very professional as I had missed out on important announcements, and I will be checking and sorting emails each day. 

Use of AI

Most team members use ChatGPT on a regular basis to help with ideas and solutions to problems. 

I also used ChatGPT especially while learning C# and other libraries and frameworks. 

There were times when I needed ChatGPT to write me a piece of code that I couldn’t work out, although the code didn’t do exactly what I intended or explained. 

Writing my report and findings for the company would have been more efficient using ChatGPT to do this, although ChatGPT has helped with ideas and learning, I thought that this might be unethical for it to write the report for me, so I decided against it.
