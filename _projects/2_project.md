As part of a creative coding assignment, I was required to create a web based game using Javascript and Javascript libraries p5js and p5play. 
The game contains images, animations, sounds and reads from a JSON file.

Missile sprites are randomly created and fall from the sky towards the ground and buildings below. The user crosshair is used to shoot defence missiles towards attack missiles. If an attack missile collides with a defence missile explosion, the attack missile explodes and bonus missiles are added to the user missile count. Special drop red planes can be shot down for bonus user missiles aswell. Game difficulty increases as time goes on, with more missiles spawning in at faster velocities. The game ends when all the buildings on the ground have been blown up by colliding attack missiles. 

This project was my introduction to reading documentation and applying code to fullfill requirements.
