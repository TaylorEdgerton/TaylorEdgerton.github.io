I enjoy travelling to remote places on my motorbike, and camping off the grid. This is a hobby I have maintained for years also in the form of 4 wheel driving and camping. Being drawn to solving problems, these experiences of travelling, preparing and fixing vehicles truly outlines my desire to solve problems and find solutions. I’m always looking for new ways to improve my current setup, and new remote places to challenge myself as well as find experiences outside of regular everyday life. Sometimes getting lost and navigating a way out is a satisfying achievement. Being self sufficient to find ways through difficult terrain, and honing these skills becomes extremely enjoyable for me. 
Photographing and documenting these experiences is also a hobby of mine, as I keep records of problems I face, places I have been and experiences I have made. Coming back with images to edit, and sharing these with friends and family, or others who I travelled with.
