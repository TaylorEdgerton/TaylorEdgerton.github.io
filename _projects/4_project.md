I was required to design and create a mobile app using Ionic that utilises local storage, modals and APIs. I decided to create a flood emergency registration app for Lismore, after the recent flood emergencies. User's input their household information, can view their location and their nearest evacuation center on a google map API.

This project introduced me to mobile app creation using Ionic, and using an android emulator to build and install the created application.
