I conducted research into users of forests surrounding the Griffith University campus in order to create a mobile app prototype called "eForest". The research described the audience intended to use the technology, as well as analysed the UI/UX effectiveness of the prototype I created. 

This project gave me insight into Mobile App UX research, as well as experience using industry-standard research tools and techniques, and prototyping tools such as Adobe XD. 

Part 1 of the project entailed an in-depth report outlining the research and findings as well as survey and interview results. 

Part 2 involved the creation mobile app prototype made with Adobe XD, along with a report and further research into the UX/UI effectiveness of this prototype.
