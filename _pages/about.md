Hi, I'm Taylor. 

I've been obsessed with tech and computers since I can remember. Building my own computers, helping Dad at work with Server Administration, and secretly nerding out at LAN parties in the 2000s playing original COD. 

I have used some seriously painful software, in my personal life aswell as the Real Estate and Retail worlds, and can say confidently that I am excited about software, web apps and mobile apps that have awesome UX and UI, made with the user in mind.

In my spare time I'm out exploring on my Suzuki DRZ400 Dirtbike, and camping on the beach. I've been 4 Wheel Driving to Cape York, although still have many remote parts of Australia on my radar to explore.

This website demonstrates my experiences and skills within software development, outlining details of projects that I have completed, aswell as containing my resume.

I am hoping to gain experience working with companies and people who share my passion. 


<!-- I enjoy the creation of digital media, websites and photography and growing up I have always had an interest in computers, how they work, and how software is created. Having an interest in building and programming web and mobile apps with the user in mind, I have decided to pursue this career further and I am currently in my last year of study at Griffith University, and have previously studied photography and design.

This website contains my resume and portfolio in order to gain more experience working for companies and with people who share my passion. -->
