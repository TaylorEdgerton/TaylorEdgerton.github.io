Specialising in industrial systems, cybersecurity, and edge technologies, I work with asset managers and operations teams to support portfolios of renewable energy and critical infrastructure sites across Australia.  

In my current role as an Automation Engineer, I focus on improving reliability, security, and efficiency across OT systems, from utility-scale renewable generation sites to gas pipeline networks.  

### Core Skills
- SCADA platforms — Ignition, Aveva PlantSCADA/Citect, GeoSCADA  
- Edge and IoT solutions — MQTT, OPC UA, REST APIs  
- Cybersecurity — risk assessments and protection strategies aligned with AESCSF  
- Cloud and containerised environments — Docker on Linux, CI/CD pipelines, scalable integrations  
- Software development and integration — delivering solutions in Python, C#, and JavaScript  

I’m building on this foundation by exploring AI and machine learning, applying advanced analytics to enable predictive maintenance, intelligent automation, and real-time operational insights across diverse asset portfolios.




<!-- I enjoy the creation of digital media, websites and photography and growing up I have always had an interest in computers, how they work, and how software is created. Having an interest in building and programming web and mobile apps with the user in mind, I have decided to pursue this career further and I am currently in my last year of study at Griffith University, and have previously studied photography and design.

​
This website contains my resume and portfolio in order to gain more experience working for companies and with people who share my passion. -->
